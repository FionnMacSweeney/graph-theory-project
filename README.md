Graph isomorphism problem is the task of determining whether two graphs are structurally identical. This is important in fields such as drug discovery, computer science, and social networks. The problem is computationally expensive and, in some cases, no efficient algorithm can solve it.

One basic brute force algorithm is to check all permutations of the nodes in one graph and see if it is identical to the other. However, this leads to exponential time complexity. More efficient algorithms, such as the VF2 and Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithms, have been developed with smaller time complexity.

Adjacency matrices are a powerful tool in graph theory and the graph isomorphism problem. They allow for efficient comparison of graphs by representing them as matrices. If two graphs have the same matrix, they are isomorphic, but if they have different matrices, they are not isomorphic.

Applications of the graph isomorphism problem include cryptography, machine learning, and the study of complex networks and social networks. It is used to create secure key exchange protocols, to match and classify graphs, and to identify similar patterns of connections between nodes.
