    "# **The Graph Isomorphism Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a mathematical structure that consists of a set of points (vertices) and a set of lines (edges) that connect them. The graph isomorphism problem is a computer science problem that involves checking whether two graphs are isomorphic, which means they have the same structure, even if the labels or positions of the vertices are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph isomorphism problem arises in many fields, including drug discovery, computer science, and social networks. For instance, drug companies use graphs to model drug molecules and apply the graph isomorphism problem to identify new drugs that are similar to existing ones. In computer science, graph isomorphism is used to optimize algorithms, while in social networks, it can help detect similar patterns of connections between users.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the graph isomorphism problem and developing algorithms to solve it, researchers can better model complex systems and make predictions based on them. However, the problem remains challenging to solve, and even today, there is no efficient algorithm that can solve it for all cases."
